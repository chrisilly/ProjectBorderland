Oh,
Hey there. Another area complete, huh?
Well done, Nigiri. You truly are the strongest one out of us all.
I truly wish things didn't turn out the way they did, but hey, what can you do?
Make the best out of the hand you've been dealt.

Staying positive, even in the toughest times, was something he excelled at.
I'd give up anything just to have one more day with him, the four of us together...
Good luck, Nigiri.
