Welcome, Nigiri.
I am Jack, one out of three game masters in this dimension.
This world was constructed by a mysterious individual who has captured you and was the one who put you here. 
You are forced to play three levels to break free.
Your mind is fractured and memory is jumbled but,
if you see any fragments along the way, try to collect them and surely they shall guide you and your mind out of here.
Here, in this land that is frozen in time, your dash possesses the power to momentarily freeze the motion of moving and falling platforms. 
Use this power to overcome the hazards and challenges that lie in your path.
Venture forth, Nigiri, and may your skills serve as your compass, guiding you towards the truth that awaits on the path ahead.
