Welcome to the first level, Nigiri. I am Jack, one out of three game masters in this Dimension.
This world was constructed by a mysterious individual who has captured you and put you in this dimension. 
You are forced to play 3 levels to break free, remember to collect the memory fragment.
Here in Frozen in Time, your dash possesses the power to momentarily freeze the motion of moving and falling platforms. 
Use this skill to overcome the hazards and challenges.
Venture forth, Nigiri, and may your skills serve as your compass, guiding you towards the truth that awaits on the path ahead.
