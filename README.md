# Project Borderland
Borderland seeks to be a difficult 2D platformer with satisfying movement and a compelling story of a coma-induced world of hurt and challenge. The game is inspired by Celeste and features four levels—including a tutorial level—in which non-playable characters offer narrative insight to the player. Collectibles can be found in each level and the ending changes depending on how many the player manages to collect.

The game was made in **Unity**. Most of the art and music assets are made by us!
